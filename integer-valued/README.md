The goal of this document is to analyse the vanishing behaviour of the polynomials g<sub>d</sub>(x) = x(x+1)...(x+d-1) on the rings Z<sub>p<sup>N</sup></sub>Z[Îµ]$. This question naturally comes up when trying to study integer-valued polynomials in number fields. Although it is a Python Notebook, it requires SageMath to run.

**Note.** The Markdown parser embedded in GitHub isn't MathJax-aware. This means that the formulas will look much better if you open this file in (say) Jupyter or Google Colab.
