The great variety of examples makes the book *Introduction to Probability Models* by Sheldon M. Ross, in my opinion, the best of its kind. Many examples I found to be highly fascinating, being both mathematically interesting and inspired by real life.

They would often come with some clever mathematical trick — almost too clever, one might say; for on some occasions the arguments threw me off-guard so much that I had trouble believing it: I needed to see it with my own eyes first. I found it helpful, therefore, to be able to toy around with the models myself. In the hope that it may be of similar help to others, I've bundled the examples together into this notebook.

I have collected examples from throughout the book, though with emphasis on Sections 3–8, progressing linearly, so that you will find that the examples become more advanced as the notebook progresses. As the book is written for mathematicians and not computer scientists, I have always chosen simplicity over efficiency in my code.

Progress: Sections 1–6 are mostly completed.
