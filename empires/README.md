This program is still in a rather rough state. To get an impression of the intention behind it take a look at the attached mp4.

To-do list to self:
- Write a readme
- Introduce random names
- Implement the real_mode = False simulation
- Give the program a more user-friendly interface
- Messages require polishing (e.g. a nice font and fontsize depending on figsize)
- Any message occurring on frame 0 is given twice
- Speed up program by only sampling on a partition of the habitable squares
- Possible memory problems with FuncAnimations if we're working with lots of iterations
- Get rid of visual artefacts for large fields --- they don't seem to be fixed by enlarging figsize
- WebM support for smaller output files?
