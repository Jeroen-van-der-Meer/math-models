I'd like to create some sort of nation state simulator, in which the growth and development of nations, as well as the battles between them, are simulated.

A first step will be autogenerating the land. It will have just a single parameter, which is survivability. To obtain this, several steps will be needed:
 - First, a terrain generation, producing a 2D height grid.
 - Then a survivability function, which depends on distance from the ocean and height.
 - Finally, a random decrease based on Perlin noise, which somewhat fluctuates in time (though, for the sake of computational gain, not every time step).

When the land is created, we initiate the simulation by putting a single tribe at a random location on the map. Development and growth of this society will be modelled by a stochastic cellular automaton, in which the creation of new land depends on the amount of land nearby, along with constraints induced by the survivability of the underlying land.

Over time, spontaneous mutations will cause the creation of a new empire. Once there are multiple empires, a question emerges how the stochatic automaton should proceed. The answer is that this should be a given by a further random variable: if the neighbours of a block consists of more than one empire, then there must always be a random factor determing whom the block will be taken by.

To slightly encourage migration across oceans, survivability of oceans should be very low but not zero. This should not, however, apply to the boundary of the map, which should be completely uninhabitable. (If we achieve this, we can simplify the computation of the neighbour spots, in that they will no longer require the computation of a %.

As for the output, I would like to produce a video in which a map of the world is shown, along with a development of the territories of the empires living on it. Additionally, it would be nice to give a graph, or an indication of the current largest empires that are existing on the map.
