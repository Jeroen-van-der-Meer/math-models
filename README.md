# polynomial-models

I have some code for studying numerically the behaviour of polynomial functions, which I'll throw into this repo. 

- ```./integer-valued``` SageMath notebook whose main goal is to analyse the vanishing behaviour of the polynomials g<sub>d</sub>(x) = x(x+1)...(x+d-1) on the rings Z<sub>p<sup>N</sup></sub>Z[Îµ]. This question naturally comes up when trying to study integer-valued polynomials in number fields.
- ```./periodicities``` A short study of the periodic behaviour of polynomial dynamical systems on the integers mod N.

# probability-models

This repository should end up containing some of my code for probabilistic simulations of various kinds. So far the contents are the following.

- ```./empires``` Stochastic cellular automaton simulating the rise and fall of nations. Currently in a rough state.
- ```./ross``` Jupyter Notebook which does some numerical simulations based on examples found in the book *Introduction to Probability Models* by Sheldon M. Ross.
