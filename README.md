# math-models

This is a catch-all repository for some mathematical models that I've used for some side projects. Most of them are probabilistic / statistical simulations, as well as some scripts for analysing problems in abstract algebra and number theory. As it stands, it contains the following folders.

- ```./embedding-points``` Algorithm to find the nearest-to-isometric embedding of collection of datapoints.
- ```./empires``` Stochastic cellular automaton simulating the rise and fall of nations.
- ```./integer-valued``` SageMath notebook whose main goal is to analyse the vanishing behaviour of the polynomials g<sub>d</sub>(x) = x(x+1)...(x+d-1) on the rings Z<sub>p<sup>N</sup></sub>Z[Îµ]. This question naturally comes up when trying to study integer-valued polynomials in number fields.
- ```./periodicities``` A short study of the periodic behaviour of polynomial dynamical systems on the integers mod N.
- ```./ross``` Jupyter Notebook which does some numerical simulations based on examples found in the book *Introduction to Probability Models* by Sheldon M. Ross.
