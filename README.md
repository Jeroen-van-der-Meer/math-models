# probability-models

This repository should end up containing some of my code for probabilistic simulations of various kinds. So far the contents are the following.

- ```./empires``` Stochastic cellular automaton simulating the rise and fall of nations. Currently in a rough state.
- ```./ross``` Jupyter Notebook which does some numerical simulations based on examples found in the book *Introduction to Probability Models* by Sheldon M. Ross.
