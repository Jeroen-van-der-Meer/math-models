# math-models

This is a catch-all repository for some mathematical models that I've used for some side projects. Most of them are probabilistic / statistical simulations, as well as some scripts for analysing problems in abstract algebra and number theory. As it stands, it contains the following folders.

- ```./benson``` Script written in GAP to numerically verify Benson's conjecture on modular 2-group representations for random examples.
- ```./embedding-points``` Algorithm to find the nearest-to-isometric embedding of collection of datapoints.
- ```./empires``` Stochastic cellular automaton simulating the rise and fall of nations.
- ```./induced-endotrivial``` Exhibits an example of an endotrivial module that fails to remain endotrivial (or even endopermutation) under induction.
- ```./integer-valued``` SageMath notebook whose main goal is to analyse the vanishing behaviour of the polynomials $g_d(x) = x(x+1)\cdots(x+d-1)$ on the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}[\varepsilon]$. This question naturally comes up when trying to study integer-valued polynomials in number fields.
- ```./periodicities``` A short study of the periodic behaviour of polynomial dynamical systems on the integers mod $N$.
- ```./ross``` Jupyter Notebook which does some numerical simulations based on examples found in the book *Introduction to Probability Models* by Sheldon M. Ross.
