# polynomial-models

I have some code for studying numerically the behaviour of polynomial functions, which I'll throw into this repo. 

- ```./integer-valued``` SageMath notebook whose main goal is to analyse the vanishing behaviour of the polynomials g<sub>d</sub>(x) = x(x+1)...(x+d-1) on the rings Z<sub>p<sup>N</sup></sub>Z[Îµ]$. This question naturally comes up when trying to study integer-valued polynomials in number fields.
