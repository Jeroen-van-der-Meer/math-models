Let $M$ be an endopermutation $H$-module over a field $k$ &mdash; that is, a $kH$-module such that $\operatorname{End}_k(M)$ has a permutation basis. Suppose $H$ lies in an ambient group $G$. Will the induced module $\operatorname{Ind}^G_H(M)$ still be an endopermutation module? There is no reason to expect this to be the case; however, verifying this by hand can be tedious, so we instead let GAP do the heavy lifting. The results can be found in ```notes.md```.
