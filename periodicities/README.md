The goal of this document is to examine the periodic behaviour of polynomial dynamical systems on the integers mod N. The main component is a Python notebook containing some numerical simulation.

Additionally, I added a C implementation for counting the number of periodic orbits of the function x -> x<sup>2</sup> + 1 mod N. My C skills are mediocre at best, so comments on this file would be especially welcome.
