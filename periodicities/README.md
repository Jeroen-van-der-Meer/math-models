The goal of this document is to examine the periodic behaviour of polynomial dynamical systems on the integers mod N. The main component is a Python notebook. I added a C implementation for counting the number of periodic orbits of the function x -> x<sup>2</sup> + 1 mod N for the purpose of submitting the sequence to OEIS.
